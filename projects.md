Deep Learning PyTorch Tutorials
====================

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/krshrimali/krshrimali.github.io/master/assets/pytorch.jpg" width="250">

[PyTorch Tutorials](https://github.com/krshrimali/Deep-Learning-Libraries/tree/master/PyTorch/Chapters) - This GitHub repo contains PyTorch Tutorials and Notes from the book: https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/deep-learning-pytorch. Highly suggest reading this book to get a good head start in PyTorch. The following topis are covered:

- **Basics of PyTorch:** Tensors, Data Loading etc.
- **Convolutional Neural Networks**
- **Visualizing Outputs from Hidden Layers**
and more.

Computer Vision Projects
===================

1. **Dimensionality-Calculation-using-Homography-Matrix-and-QR-Code-Detection** (C++ and Python)
    - OpenCV based dimensional measurement of a book cover using Homography and Ratio comparison.
    - **What it does?**: Approximation of the dimensions of a cover page of a book using techniques: Homography Algorithms, (QR Code Detection using Zbar). 
    - **How it does?**: QR Code generation using any online web service. [Example: https://www.qr-code-generator.com/]
       * Detection of the QR Code and Text generation [encoded in the QR code - assuming text or any hyperlink etc.] using zbar module in Python. Credits: learnopencv.com
       * Printing out the QR Code on a page, assuming it to be on a book - take the snap of it, and determine the approximate dimensions of the book cover, using the measured (manually) dimensions of the QR code.
       * Note: The QR Code detection has been shown in qr_code_detection.py file, although in the book dimension code - a text has been assumed instead of QR code because of some unavailability of the printing facilities. The version for QR code will be out soon.
       * Homography technique is used, feature detection, choosing the image of the QR code as the selected area.
