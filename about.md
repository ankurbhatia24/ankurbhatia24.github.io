* **Winner Ennovate 2019** -  
Ennovate is an Innovation based competition being organized by GrowVation and DIC, Panjab University. It involved the building of an idea into a prototype and to pitch it in front of jury from various domains. After the idea submission round, we had enough time to develop and test a prototype model. People from vast backgrounds and organizations were available like Mathworks, ISRO, IBHubs, IIM Bangalore, etc. for networking and judgment. We presented our idea through a Poster and discussed the pros and cons of its development and suitability in India. Overall we managed to win the competition with great vigour. 
Cheers to the team Melodic Bits: Ankur Bhatia, Ananya Duggal, Dhawal Sharda. <br>

## Teaching


## Extra Curricular
* **Cajon** - I was in my second year when I heard this amazing song being played in a concert on the beats of a musical instrument known as – Cajon. Being a drums player myself in school days, my curiosity peaked and I bought the instrument online. Having no access to a real-life trainer, I turned to Youtube for help. I saw numerous tutorials on my PC and learned to master the instrument with the help of a reel life trainer. Now, I perform this instrument on many concerts and functions and sometimes also get to fill my pocket. <br>

* **Participation in RedBull Can You Make It** -
From the 10th – 17th of April, 200+ student teams from 60+ countries across the globe will hand over their cash, cards and phones and be transported to either Madrid, Budapest, Manchester, Stockholm or Rome. From there, they have seven days to reach Amsterdam, hitting checkpoints at major cities along the way and using their charm, whit and ingenuity to do so. <br> The competition is a dash to finish line, but winning isn’t the main intention: it’s not about when you get there, but how. Teams will have to cover more than 1,000 miles in one week before reaching the final destination, using nothing but Red Bull cans as currency. <br>
**Our entry only reached to top in city level :p** <br>
