* **Winner Ennovate 2019** -  
Ennovate is an Innovation based competition being organized by GrowVation and DIC, Panjab University. It involved the building of an idea into a prototype and to pitch it in front of jury from various domains. After the idea submission round, we had enough time to develop and test a prototype model. People from vast backgrounds and organizations were available like Mathworks, ISRO, IBHubs, IIM Bangalore, etc. for networking and judgment. We presented our idea through a Poster and discussed the pros and cons of its development and suitability in India. Overall we managed to win the competition with great vigour. 
Cheers to the team Melodic Bits: Ankur Bhatia, Ananya Duggal, Dhawal Sharda. <br>
