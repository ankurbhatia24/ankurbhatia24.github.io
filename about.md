## Experience  

* **Celestini Program India, The Marconi Society at IIT Delhi** -  
Among the 75 teams, our team selected in the top 5 teams from India. Interview One was an Online Test in which we need to solve 5 Problems related to Programming, Machine Learning, Image Processing and Probability. Interview 2 was a 30 min video call with Dr. Aakanksha Chowdhery related to our experence and knowledge of the domains. <br>
Followed by the selection, we carried our Research and Development at Samsung Innovation Labs at Bharti School of Telecommunications, IIT Delhi for about 3 months. We worked on Monitoring and forecasting of Air Pollution in the city of New Delhi, working with local sensors and Governmental Data from Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). <br>

* **Winner Ennovate 2019** -  
Ennovate is an Innovation based competition being organized by GrowVation and DIC, Panjab University. It involved the building of an idea into a prototype and to pitch it in front of jury from various domains. After the idea submission round, we had enough time to develop and test a prototype model. People from vast backgrounds and organizations were available like Mathworks, ISRO, IBHubs, IIM Bangalore, etc. for networking and judgment. We presented our idea through a Poster and discussed the pros and cons of its development and suitability in India. Overall we managed to win the competition with great vigour. 
Cheers to the team Melodic Bits: Ankur Bhatia, Ananya Duggal, Dhawal Sharda. <br>

* **Mentor, Programming Club (Pclub)** - is a student-run club that is involved in effective teaching and collaborating on learning programming languages and frameworks. It aims at educating students and to spread selfless knowledge of various domains of Computer Science, organizes hackathons, and celebrate Open-Source. It's not like a normal club in college that holds recruitments for students. It’s an open community, because we believe the more we share, the more we learn from others. We take weekly sessions on various domains.To know more follow us on:  <br>

2. **Session on Git and GitHub:**
- Merging multiple commits (squash).
- Stashing.
- Reverting commits, removing commits (soft and hard resets)
- Resolving merge conflicts (locally and remotely (from github gui))
- About Hacktoberfest

3. **Session on Python - covering basic syntax and useful libraries.**

4. **Session on Linux, OpenSource Development and Hacktoberfest:** Hacktoberfest is open to everyone in our global community. Whether you’re a developer, student learning to code, event host, or company of any size, you can help drive growth of open source and make positive contributions to an ever-growing community. All backgrounds and skill levels are encouraged to complete the challenge. During Hacktoberfest each participant needs to do atleast 4 pull request to receive a Tshirt and schwags. One can contribute in any open source project available on @github. At UIET, we would be bringing some awesome open source contributers and maintainers to provide insights of how effective an open source contribution can be. You'll learn how to start looking into big organizations and get yourselves prepared for the summer of codes programmes. We'll help you all explore awesome github repositories and also help in understanding the github flow. NOTE: Make sure you get yourselves registered on the Hacktoberfest website (https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com) to make your contributions count. Small Competition among peers: The one who will do the highest number of Pull Requests by 15th October will get some awesome @jetbrains Schwags.

## Extra Curricular
* **Cajon** - I was in my second year when I heard this amazing song being played in a concert on the beats of a musical instrument known as – Cajon. Being a drums player myself in school days, my curiosity peaked and I bought the instrument online. Having no access to a real-life trainer, I turned to Youtube for help. I saw numerous tutorials on my PC and learned to master the instrument with the help of a reel life trainer. Now, I perform this instrument on many concerts and functions and sometimes also get to fill my pocket. <br>

* **Participation in RedBull Can You Make It** -
From the 10th – 17th of April, 200+ student teams from 60+ countries across the globe will hand over their cash, cards and phones and be transported to either Madrid, Budapest, Manchester, Stockholm or Rome. From there, they have seven days to reach Amsterdam, hitting checkpoints at major cities along the way and using their charm, whit and ingenuity to do so. <br> The competition is a dash to finish line, but winning isn’t the main intention: it’s not about when you get there, but how. Teams will have to cover more than 1,000 miles in one week before reaching the final destination, using nothing but Red Bull cans as currency. <br>
**Our entry only reached to top in city level :p** <br>
