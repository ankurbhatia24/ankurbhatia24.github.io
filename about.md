* **Winner Ennovate 2019** -  
Ennovate is an Innovation based competition being organized by GrowVation and DIC, Panjab University. It involved the building of an idea into a prototype and to pitch it in front of jury from various domains. After the idea submission round, we had enough time to develop and test a prototype model. People from vast backgrounds and organizations were available like Mathworks, ISRO, IBHubs, IIM Bangalore, etc. for networking and judgment. We presented our idea through a Poster and discussed the pros and cons of its development and suitability in India. Overall we managed to win the competition with great vigour. 
Cheers to the team Melodic Bits: Ankur Bhatia, Ananya Duggal, Dhawal Sharda. <br>

* **Cajon** - I was in my second year when I heard this amazing song being played in a concert on the beats of a musical instrument known as – Cajon. Being a drums player myself in school days, my curiosity peaked and I bought the instrument online. Having no access to a real-life trainer, I turned to Youtube for help. I saw numerous tutorials on my PC and learned to master the instrument with the help of a reel life trainer. Now, I perform this instrument on many concerts and functions and sometimes also get to fill my pocket. <br>
