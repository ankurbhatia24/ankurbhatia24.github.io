## About Me

Hello World! I'm Ankur Bhatia, Pre-final Year Undergraduate at University Institute of Engineering and Technology, Panjab University with major in Electronics and Communications Engineering. My research interests are Computer Vision and Robotics. I've previously worked at the *Center of Intelligent Robotics, IIIT, Allahabad* and *Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi under Celestini Program India conducted by The Marconi Society*.

I am currently open to 3 Month Internship Opportunities and my near goal is to do a Ph.D. in the field of Robotics.

Please navigate to <a href="https://krshrimali.github.io/pytorch/">PyTorch</a> or <a href="https://krshrimali.github.io/opencv/">OpenCV</a> section of this blog to read my blogs.

## Work Experience

- **Center of Intelligent Robotics, IIIT, Allahabad** 
    - On-site internship at ROSE Labs, NTU Singapore under Prof. Alex Kot (Director, ROSE Labs). Worked on Automatic License Plate Recognition technique in real time using PyTorch in both C++ and Python. Used YOLO based network and achieved 85% accuracy for Single Line License Plates and Double Line License Plates (tested on real time dataset of Singaporean Vehicles).
- **IIT, Delhi, The Marconi Society**
	- Worked from home in writing blogs and working for clients for Big Vision LLC. Became OpenCV Contributor during my internship, and worked on several projects using C, C++ and Python.
- **Design and Innovation Center, UIET, Panjab University** 
	- On-site internship at IIITM Gwalior and worked on A* Search Algorithm to understand communication between a robot and a UAV.
- **OpenStudy, Palo Alto**
	- The responsibilities included to actively promote the website and itâ€™s cause amongst the students and to guide them through the beginning steps for the website. Made sure the smooth following of Code of Conduct of OpenStudy. Also worked as a leader of OpenStudy Newsletter Programme for two editions as well as Designer in one edition.
- **Programming Club, UIET**
	- Coordinated clubs running under SAC: Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Club, The Society of Coders. Also became the Technical Coordinator of Annual Technical and Cultural Fest - TechNovate 2019.
