# Paper Review on Ranknet <img src="/assets/HomePage_Blogs/new_small.gif"> <br>
In this video, we understand about Ranknet. Learning to Rank using Ranknet (by Microsoft) is a Ranking Algorithm that is used to rank the results of a query.

Also, this paper presents a probabilistic cost function and learning using Gradient Descent.<br>
